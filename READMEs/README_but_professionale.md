# Professionale Readme
This read me is supposed to document and give the end-user a better idea of what each file on this repository does.

### You can find .exe files for all of those programs on the [github backup repo](https://github.com/Temium2Lilith/silly-programs), although running the .py files themselves will suffice.

# ⚠️ IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER ⚠️
Some of the code provided here is malicious by nature and can cause harm to the end-user if run. 
WE DO NOT TAKE ANY ACCOUNTIBILITY OR CREDIBILITY FOR ANY DAMAGE AND/OR LOSS OF DATA THAT OCCURS ON YOUR OWN DEVICE DUE TO THE EXECUTION OF THIS CODE.
YOU ARE RUNNING THIS CODE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

# Gaster Project
This script in of itself is pretty simple. It comes in two parts, the "keylogger" and the image display.
Now, don't fret, the "keylogger" that comes with this software doesn't make any external connections nor is it much of an actual keylogger. The only thing qualifying it for a keylogger is the fact that it consistantly listens to your keyboard inputs no matter what you are doing on your PC and logs them internally on your computer. (A literal key**logger**) It then checks those logs to see if a specific string of letters has been typed in by the end-user, and if so, it calles a function that displays an image of W.D Gaster, plays a silly sound, and then proceeds to restart your computer.

## DISCLAIMER
Running this code can result in loss of important data. Run at your own risk.

## Explenation
This python script is a simple rock, paper, scissors project with a bit of a gnarly twist. If you lose, a random file will be deleted from your users directory. (Put a more technical explenation of how it works here)

# What's next?
Me and CoffeeTable (my friend) will continue making coding shitposts until we get bored of it probably. So, do expect some new python scripts to appear here at some point.
Stay Tuned ;3
